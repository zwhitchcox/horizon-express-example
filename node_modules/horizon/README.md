# **Horizon** is a realtime, open-source backend for JavaScript apps.

Rapidly build and deploy web or mobile apps using a simple JavaScript API. Scale your apps to millions of users without any backend code.

Horizon consists of three components:

* Horizon server: a middleware server that connects to/is built on top of RethinkDB, and exposes a simple API/protocol to front-end applications.
* Horizon client: a JavaScript client library that wraps Horizon serverâ€™s protocol in a convenient API for front-end developers.
* Horizon CLI: a command line tool, hz, aiding in scaffolding, development, and deployment.

Built by the [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) team and an open-source community, Horizon lets you build sophisticated apps with lightning speed.
